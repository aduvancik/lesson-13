              Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
              looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to their
              own section. Continue reading for an introduction to the
              documentation, Native Components,React, and more!

              React Native is an open source framework for building Android and
              iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native
              capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
              platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior
              of your UI using React components:
              <i>bundles of reusable, nestable code.</i> You can learn more
              about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
              components work in React Native.

              React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
              building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of
              React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
              can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p>
              <span class="weight-700">+ components.</span> The rest of this
              introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
              approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="weight-700">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use
              JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like
              so:
              <span class="teg"
                >&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to
              learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables
              inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
              <span class="teg">name</span>, and embedding it with curly braces
              inside
              <span class="teg">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="weight-700">+ props.</span> Props is short for
              ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="weight-700">+ state.</span>
              While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
              components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data
              storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
              or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
              memory!

        <div class="block-text">
          <div class="title-p">
            <h2>handling text input</h2>
            <div class="chapter">
              <p>Chapter 4</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p>
              TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text.
              It has an <i>onChangeText</i> prop that takes a function to be
              called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop
              that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating
              their words into a different language. In this new language, every
              single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello
              there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
